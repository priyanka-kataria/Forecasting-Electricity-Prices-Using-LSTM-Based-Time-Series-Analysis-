Forecasting-Electricity-Prices-Using-LSTM-Based-Time-Series-Analysis-
This is formulated as a time series forecasting problem, where the aim is to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in the data. To address this, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based deep learning model is used, as it is well-suited for handling sequential data and long-term dependencies. The approach involves cleaning and preprocessing the data by removing irrelevant or highly correlated features, handling missing values, and preparing it for model training to predict future electricity prices effectively.
